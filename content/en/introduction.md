# Introduction to the Inca Empire

The Inca Empire, known in Quechua as **Tawantinsuyu** ("the four united regions"),
was a major Andean state that reached its greatest expansion in the 15th century.
Its capital city was **Cusco**, located in the highlands of present-day Peru.

At its height, the Inca Empire controlled territories that now belong to Peru,
Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, and Colombia. Despite not using an alphabetic
writing system, the Incas developed sophisticated methods of administration,
record-keeping (such as **quipu**), and an extensive road network.

Historians often divide Inca history into:

- **Origins and formation** in the Cusco valley.
- **Imperial expansion** under rulers like Pachacuti and Túpac Yupanqui.
- **Crisis and fall** during internal civil wars and the Spanish conquest in the 16th century.
