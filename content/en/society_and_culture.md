# Inca society and culture

Inca society was highly organized and hierarchical. At the top stood the **Sapa Inca**,
considered a descendant of the sun. Below him were the nobility, administrators,
and, at the base, the farming communities.

Key elements:

- **Ayllu**: basic unit of social and economic organization.
- **Mit’a**: labor system that required communities to work on state projects,
  such as roads and agricultural terraces.
- **Religion**: worship of **Inti** (the sun god) and other deities linked to nature.
